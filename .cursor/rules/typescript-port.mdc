# TypeScript Port Context

This project is a TypeScript port of BrogueCE (C roguelike). Before starting work:

1. Read the master initiative: [BRIEF.md](mdc:initiatives/typescript-port/BRIEF.md), [PLAN.md](mdc:initiatives/typescript-port/PLAN.md), and [TASKS.md](mdc:initiatives/typescript-port/TASKS.md)
2. Check which child initiative is currently active in TASKS.md and read its BRIEF/PLAN/TASKS
3. Consult [manifest.yaml](mdc:.context/manifest.yaml) to locate C source files by responsibility
4. Consult [PROJECT.md](mdc:.context/PROJECT.md) for overall project context
5. Follow the workflow conventions in [WORKFLOW.md](mdc:.context/WORKFLOW.md)

After completing a task, update both the active child initiative's TASKS.md and the master TASKS.md.
